This repository contains various standardized and proposed Do Not Track
policies which can be posted by domains in order to signal to that the domain
honors Do Not Track as a strong privacy opt out.  Privacy enhancing software
can check for these policies and make a corresponding determination about how
to treat the domain.

Currently, there is the temporary standardized [preliminary DNT
policy](https://github.com/EFForg/dnt-policy/blob/master/dnt-policy-preliminary.txt)
that is used by the [Privacy Badger](https://eff.org/privacy-badger) alpha
release.  There is also a [discussion
draft](https://github.com/EFForg/dnt-policy/blob/master/dnt-policy-discussion-draft.txt)
of a a full DNT policy, which will become a 1.0 standard in the future.
